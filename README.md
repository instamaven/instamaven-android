**InstaMaven** is a public help system. It allows to register users via social networks (Facebook, Twitter & Google+) and to post their ads (named **badges**) to promote yourselves as online assistants (named **merchants**). The WEB site allows you to view, search or manage your badges only. To make a video call you have to install **InstaMaven App** for Android or iOS.

Badges are divided into categories and may contain image, descriptive text, contact info etc. Every badge can be published to one or several categories. Every category has its own price to show badges.

The system allows to make a simple search by keywords or filter the badges by categories, distance and so on. The search results can be shown as list or map view.

Every badge can be placed into favorites list to access it later. Additionally the link to the badge can be shared to your friends.

Users can find an assistant and make a video call. Video call time is unlimited, call fee is up to badge owner and is measured in **coins** (inner currency). An owner can set the price as flat rate or on per minute basis.

When video call is finished user can leave the comment and rate an assistant. This info is available to review by others and can help to choose the right person to be assisted by.

After every video call the **InstaMaven** creates inner transaction and move the sum of call fee from user to  merchant. Both users receive push notifications and the list of transactions are available to review in personal account.

Users can convert their coins into real money by using "Withdraw" button in account. To add coins into account push "Recharge" button.

**InstaMaven App** is a straightforward but powerful tool to make money with your professional skills.
